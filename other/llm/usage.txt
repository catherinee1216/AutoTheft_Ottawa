User:"proofread "[FIGURE 3] shows the number of cars recovered and not recovered from 2018-2023. Overall, it is clear that more cars are recovered, with the exception of 2023, where more cars were not recovered compared to recovered. From 2018-2021, more cars were recovered than unrecovered. In 2018, 570 cars were recovered out of 914 (Figure 1) , showing that the year had a 62% recovery rate. 2019 had a similar recovery rate of 63%. The year had a total of 1012 (Figure 1) cars stolen, and 646 (Figure 3) were recovered. In 2020, 529 out of 891 cars were recovered, making the recovery rate 59%. 2021 had a slightly lower recovery rate of 53%, with 1157 cars stolen and 623 recovered. 2022 had the highest number of both recovered cars, with a total count of 1080 as well as unrecovered cars, with a total count of 1079. From [FIGURE 1] we understand that a total of 2159 cars were stolen in Ottawa in 2022. In [FIGURE 3] we can see that 1080 out of 219 was recovered, equalling to a 50% recovery rate in 2022. 2023 is the only year where the number of cars recovered is less than the number of cars not recovered. In 2023, a total of 693 cars were stolen (Figure 1) and only 334 cars were recovered (Figure 3). Hence, in 2023, the recovery rate was 48%. [FIGURE 3] shows that between 2018-2023, the recovery rate averages roughly between 60-50%.
